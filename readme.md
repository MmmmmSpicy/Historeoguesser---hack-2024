Hey there! Just some important notes here:

-  **You must run this on a live server!** To connect with the Google Map API, the files have to be able to connect to the internet,
   so a live server is required. The easiest way to do this is using the Live Server extension in VSCode.

-  To run the file, run *index.html* on the live server. Everything else should take care of itself!

- That's it for now! Enjoy the game! :)
